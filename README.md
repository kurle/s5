# PyTorch Project for Image Classification

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification using the MNIST dataset.

## Project Structure

* **S5.ipynb:**  Main Jupyter Notebook script containing model training, evaluation, and potentially visualization code.
* **model.py:** Contains the definition of the `Net` class, representing the CNN architecture.
* **utils.py** Holds utility functions, including:
    * `test`: Trains the model for a single epoch.
    * `train`: Evaluates the model on the test dataset.
    * `plot_train_metrics`: Plot loss and accuracy for train and test.

## How to Run

**1.  Dependencies**

*   Python 3.x
*   PyTorch (refer to the official PyTorch website for installation instructions: https://pytorch.org)
*   torchvision
*   NumPy
*   matplotlib (Optional, for visualizations)
*   tqdm (Optional, for progress bars)

**2. Running the Code**

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open `S5.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3.  Execute the cells in order to train the model and evaluate its performance.
